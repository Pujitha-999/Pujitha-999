âš¡ Fun fact: Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space, but did you know that approximately 68% of the universe is dark energy and 27% is dark matter? Regular matter, the stuff we can see and interact with, makes up just 5% of the universe's total content. It's a fascinating aspect of cosmology!
